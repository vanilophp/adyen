# Adyen Payment Workflow

The typical Vanilo Payments workflow with Adyen consists of the
following steps:

1. Have an **Order** (or any
   ["Payable"](https://vanilo.io/docs/2.x/payments#payables)), along with an Adyen payment method.
2. Use a **gateway instance** to generate a **payment request**
3. Inject the **HTML snippet** generated by the payment request into the checkout thankyou page
4. The shopper will complete the payment details using the **Adyen Drop-in frontend**
5. Your backend receives the payment form (asynchronously) and **submits the payment to Adyen**
6. You pass back Adyen's response to the frontend
7. Depending on the response, frontend may either finish the payment or perform **additional actions** (redirect, QR code, etc)
8. Frontend may request **additional payment details** from your backend
9. Frontend may **redirect** the shopper to another page (eg. to the shopper's Bank for 3DS)
10. Adyen will send the shopper back to the **return URL**
11. Adyen communicates the transaction status/events to your backend via **webhooks**.

Steps 1-7 are happening with every Adyen payment, whereas steps 8-11 may
or may not happen, depending on the specific payment type of a transaction.

## Obtain Gateway Instance

Once you have an order (or any other payable), then the starting point
of payment operations is obtaining a gateway instance:

```php
$gateway = \Vanilo\Payment\PaymentGateways::make('adyen');
// Vanilo\Adyen\AdyenPaymentGateway
```

The gateway provides you two essential methods:

- `createPaymentRequest` - Assembles the payment initiation request from
  an order (payable) that can be injected on your checkout page.
- `processPaymentResponse` - Processes the HTTP response returning from
  Adyen after a payment attempt.

## Starting Online Payments

**Controller:**

```php
use Vanilo\Framework\Models\Order;
use Vanilo\Payment\Factories\PaymentFactory;
use Vanilo\Payment\Models\PaymentMethod;
use Vanilo\Payment\PaymentGateways;

class OrderController
{
    public function submit(Request $request)
    {
        $order = Order::createFrom($request);
        $paymentMethod = PaymentMethod::find($request->get('paymentMethod'));
        $payment = PaymentFactory::createFromPayable($order, $paymentMethod);
        $gateway = PaymentGateways::make('adyen');
        $paymentRequest = $gateway->createPaymentRequest($payment);
        
        return view('order.confirmation', [
            'order' => $order,
            'paymentRequest' => $paymentRequest
        ]);
    }
}
```

**Blade Template:**

```blade
{!! $paymentRequest->getHtmlSnippet(); !!}
```

The generated HTML snippet will contain a prepared, HTML Form ready to
pay with Adyen.

### Payment Request Options

The gateway's `createPaymentRequest` method accepts additional
parameters that can be used to customize the generated request.

The signature of the method is the following:

```php
public function createPaymentRequest(
    Payment $payment,
    Address $shippingAddress = null,
    array $options = []
    ): PaymentRequest
```

1. The first parameter is the `$payment`. Every attempt to settle a
   payable is a new `Payment` record.
2. Shipping address is not supported by Adyen. Leave it to NULL.
3. The third parameters is an array with possible `$options`.

You can pass the following values in the `$options` array:

| Array Key      | Example                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `view`         | `vanilo.adyen._form`                                      | By default it's `adyen::_request` You can use a custom blade view to render the HTML snippet instead of the default one this library provides. |
| `locale`       | `nl-NL`                                                   | The locale used by Adyen to render the frontend                                                                                                |
| `urls.submit`  | `route('payment.adyen.submit', $payment->getPaymentId())` | The URL at your application where the filled payment form gets submitted                                                                       |
| `urls.details` | `http://localhost/checkout/adyen/details?payment=XYZ123`  | The URL at your application that handles "more details" situations                                                                             |

Passing these values is optional. If nothing passed, the configuration
values will be used.

**Example**:

```php
$options = [
    'view' => 'vanilo.adyen._form',
    'locale' => 'pt-BR', // defaults to 'en-US' if omitted
    'urls'  => [
        'submit' => route('app.adyen.submit', $payment->getPaymentId()),
        'details' => route('app.adyen.submit', $payment->getPaymentId()),
    ]
];
$gateway->createPaymentRequest($payment, null, $options);
```

#### Customizing The Generated HTML

Apart from passing the `view` option to the `createPaymentRequest` (see
above), there's an even more simple way: Laravel lets you
[override the views from vendor packages](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/packages#overriding-package-views)
like this.

Simply put, if you create the
`resources/views/vendor/adyen/_request.blade.php` file in your
application, then this blade view will be used instead of the one
supplied by the package.

To get the default view from the package and start customizing it, use
this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=vanilo-adyen
```

This will copy the default blade view used to render the HTML form into
the `resources/views/vendor/adyen/` folder of your application. After
that, the `getHtmlSnippet()` method will use the copied blade template
to render the HTML snippet for Adyen payment requests.

## Process Submitted Form

> See the [Configuration Section](configuration.md#setting-urls) for more details.

The "Submit URL" is an endpoint in your application that gets called by
the Adyen frontend once a customer has completed the payment details and
clicks the "Pay" button.

The Adyen Gateway has a special method called `submitPaymentToAdyen`
that can parse the input of the Drop-in and create a payment with the
Adyen API. This step is necessary.

The method also returns a response that directly can be used as the
response so that the Drop-in component can understand it.
